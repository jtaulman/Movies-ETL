# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

The goal of this analysis was to refactor the code, so that the movie data was easier to read and comprehend. There were a lot of duplicates and errors, so I was tasked with putting everything into clean tables.

## Summary

The movie data was reorganized and has become easier to understand. The tables presented break down each part of the data in a clear and concise manner. For quick access there are pictures to represent the tables and data provided in the Resources folder above. The only issue presented was involving the ratings.csv file. The file was too large for my laptop to handle so my code does not represent all 26,000,000 rows.
